# üß† Surgical Tool and Organ Segmentation 

---

## üéØ Aim:

To develop a lightweight, real-time computer vision system that can:
- Detect surgical tools during procedures
- Identify and segment anatomical structures such as organs, arteries, and fluids
- Run efficiently on low-power Edge AI hardware for potential operating room integration or robotic assistance

The system is designed to be practical for intraoperative use, training simulation, or post-surgical analysis.

## üìö Dataset Sources:

The models are trained and evaluated on publicly available surgical video datasets:

1. **CholecSeg8k**  
   üëâ https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/newslab/cholecseg8k  
   > Annotated laparoscopic cholecystectomy dataset with organ and tool segmentation masks

2. **Stanford Tool Detection Dataset (m2cai16-tool-locations)**  
   üëâ https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/tooldetection.html  
   > Real-time labeled frames from cholecystectomy procedures for surgical tool detection

Both datasets contain pixel-level or bounding-box annotations, and were adapted into a consistent semantic segmentation format with a 19 (12+7)-class label mapping.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Procedure:

1. **Label Mapping**  
   - A JSON file defines 19 unique classes (organs, tools, fluids, arteries), each with a distinct RGB color

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Color masks converted to class-index masks
   - Normalization, augmentation, resizing for model training

3. **Model Training**  
   - **YOLOv8 Nano (Segmentation head)** used for object/ tool detection  (7 tools)
   - **UNET+MobileNetV2** and **YOLOv8 Nano (Semantic Segmentation)** used for semantic segmentation (12 parts)
   - Both models trained and evaluated separately, with overlays rendered on test video

4. **Video Inference Pipeline**  
   - Test video frames are processed in real-time
   - YOLOv8 models run side-by-side on each frame
   - Output video visualizes predictions from both models for qualitative comparison

## üíª Devices Aimed to Run On:

The system is optimized for real-time execution on lightweight and embedded hardware platforms:

- ‚ö° **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**
- ‚ö° **Raspberry Pi 4 or 5**
- ‚ö° **Texas Instruments SK-AM62ALP**
- ‚ö° **Microchip PolarFire Icicle Kit**
- üíª Regular desktops with GPU (for training and high-res testing)
